                        In the last 5 years, the demand for ZW Inc.â€™s technology has been on a steady decline. 
                        The revenue has been declining steadily declining, number of hardware devices rented and bought 
                        has been on a decline and software developed has declined. The competition has increased with 
                        emergence of Flintstones technology, who also provide barcode and QR code technology. A quarter 
                        of their regular clients have left us for Flintstones technologies. ZW Inc. has also failed to 
                        secure investors through financial markets, to fund their growth strategies.
